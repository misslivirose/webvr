# webvr
This is a sample project for experimenting with Three.js and rendering sites with HMDs through the WebVR API.

## Notes
You will need the Firefox Nightly build or a WebVR-enabled version of Chromium for viewing demos; other browsers will just display a white screen as they do not have the navigator.getVRDevices functionality enabled.

[Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/) now has the WebVR API included in the builds, but this is only enabled for the desktop browser, and not mobile yet.

[Chromium](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzudLt22BqGRbW9WTHMtOWMzNjQ)  doesn't have the WebVR API on all of the builds, but you can grab one from here that does. I'm using the December 17th version for testing, with plans to update when newer builds come out.
